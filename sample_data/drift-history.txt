1293112500 -1 ADJUST: +100 ms/day to 27000 thanks to Hilary Costello and Alice Cicirello
1292934600 -1 ADJUST: -500 ms/day to 26900 
1292751480 -1 Bedmaker Effect, interim conclusion:  1:  opening the door in the room below on a cold day causes the air flow in the pendulum chute to change (a cold downwards air flow is replaced by a warm upwards air flow) because of the chimney effect forced by the tall heated staircase in the building.  2:  as the air warms up, the density and viscosity of the air both fall allowing the swing amplitude to increase.  3:  The change in direction of air flow (downward to upward) causes the Going to drop (the clock slows down) because upward drag on the pendulum causes an apparent reduction in g.   
1292751420 -1 Bedmaker Effect (continued) 2: the Going changes more dramatically http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=19/12/2010&channel=going&channel2=temp&type=two&scale=auto&xmin=9&xmax=11&skip=2 .  What is interesting is that there is a step change in going of about -900ms/day and this occurs straight away, not at all related to the gradual temperature rise.  This is clear in the scatter plot http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=19/12/2010&channel=going&channel2=temp&type=xy&scale=auto (ok, there is a gradient at the expected slope due to thermal expansion, but this is after te initial step occurs.  It was Dwight Elvey who made me look again at this, and I think he is right - the observed change in going could well be due to the change in air flow up the chute.  If descending cold air is replaced by rising warmer air then the sudden change in direction of air flow will cause a change in Going.  This has been looked at in the Theory section of the website, and in Section 4.6.4 and estimate was calculated as -300ms/day per 1m/s of upward air flow.  This suggests that the change in upward air flow this morning should have been around 3m/s - which is pretty fast.  Certainly measurable.  I will have to invest in a digital anemometer now!
1292751360 -1 Bedmaker Effect (continued) So, here are some observations:  1: amplitude changes linearly with temperature, as can be seen in a scatter plot http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=19/12/2010&channel=amp&channel2=temp&type=xy&scale=auto and the fact that the rise curve and the fall curve follow each other (ie there is no hysteresis) really suggests that the temperature sensor responds quickly to temperature change and that the amplitude measurement is due to air temperature change.  The gradient is about 0.8mrad/C which agrees really well with theory for how drag varies with air density.  Nothing definite yet, but the evidence for this theory is mounting.  
1292751300 -1 Bedmaker Effect, just opening the door (no bedmaker!) on a cold morning, -4C outside.  Heating on inside, really toasty.  So, opening the door causes a chimney effect, forcing warm air into the pendulum chute.  This temperature rise can now be seen http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=19/12/2010&channel=amp&channel2=temp&type=two&scale=auto&xmin=9&xmax=11&skip=0 because the weather station is located in the pendulum chute itself.  I have made some observations and these are in separate comments above.
1292673600 -1 It is good to see that the clock has settled down to where it was.  http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=18/12/2010&xmin=9&xmax=12&skip=2&channel=amp&channel2=drift&type=two&ymin=47.8&ymax=48.1&y2min=-0.285&y2max=-0.25
1292673660 -1 Conclusion on temperature sensitivity of sensor:  It seems that the sensor setup is not temperature sensitive over the range of temperature changes observed in the Bedmaker Effect (below 1C change).  The key indicator is seen here http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=17/12/2010&to=19/12/2010&channel=amp&channel2=going&type=two&scale=auto&skip=50 where the amplitude change when a hairdrier is blown onto the sensor is in the wrong direction.
1292665167 -1 Expt 3: http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=18/12/2010&xmin=9&xmax=10&skip=2&channel=amp&channel2=drift&type=two&ymin=47.8&ymax=48.1&y2min=-0.285&y2max=-0.275   Now a hair drier is used to warm up the sensor, and at the same time part of the pendulum shaft is warmed up (it is not possible with a hair drier to target the sensor being so close to the pednulum shaft).  We see that there is a small change in indicated amplitude, and this is downwards consistent with the negative temperature sensitivity of the sensor as found in expt 1.  But most significant is a very large change in going (slope of the drift) to -1700ms/day.  This is consistent with lengthening of the pendulum due to thermal expansion, and it is a large effect because the hair drier is quite hot.
1292664816 -1 Here http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=18/12/2010&xmin=9&xmax=10&skip=2&channel=amp&channel2=drift&type=two&ymin=47.8&ymax=48.1&y2min=-0.285&y2max=-0.275  I bumped the pendulum while moving the temperature sensor into the pendulum chamber.  The idea now is that the temperature indicated on the website is now the temperature inside the pendulum chamber rather than in the clock case.
1292664093 -1 Expt 2: http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=18/12/2010&xmin=9&xmax=10&skip=2&channel=amp&channel2=drift&type=two&ymin=47.8&ymax=48.1&y2min=-0.285&y2max=-0.275   The same again, but the soldering iron is in place for about 5 minutes.  This time there is a bigger effect on amplitude (about -0.2mrad) but again no significant effect on going.  The thing to note is that the indicated amplitude change is negative, so that the effect of rising temperature is to reduce the indicated amplitude, but temperature change does not appreciably change the indicated rate of Going.  The air temperature that the soldering iron produces around the sensor is HOT - very much higher than anything that the central heating will produce.  It seems then that while the sensor is indeed temperature sensitive it cannot explain the Bedmaker Effect.
1292663850 -1 Experiments,  in the light of helpful comments by Dwight Elvey who rightly points out that the optic sensor is probably temperature senitive.  See http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=18/12/2010&xmin=9&xmax=10&skip=2&channel=amp&channel2=drift&type=two&ymin=47.8&ymax=48.1&y2min=-0.285&y2max=-0.275 .  Expt 1:  placed a hot soldering iron under the sensor for about 30 seconds (wanting to warm up the sensor without warming up anything else).   Note that the amplitude drops by about 0.05mrad while the going (slope of the drift) is unchanged. 
1292576700 -1 It is good to see a prediction come true!  Interesting to note, with a longer period of the door being open, that the amplitude looks to be increasing exponentially by about 0.4mrad at a time constant of about 20 minutes.  The going does not show any decay - just a step of about -450ms/day.  This reinforces the theory that the change in going is due to a change in length of the outer tube due to thermal expansion - corresponds to a temperature change of +1C.  The puzzle to figure out now is a mechanism for the observed change in amplitude that corresponds to a change of +1C.  
1292571600 -1 I asked the bedmaker to leave the door open for 20 minutes today http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=17/12/2010&xmin=7&xmax=9&channel=amp&skip=5&scale=auto .  Another concern:  is the barometric compensator working  http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=15/12/2010&to=17/12/2010&channel=going&channel2=pressure&type=xy&scale=auto ?    The blue data points should form a horizontal line - but they are following the -8ms/day per mbar lines exactly as we had before the compensator was installed.
1292424600 -1 ADJUST: +200 ms/day to 27400 - not getting this nailed as quickly as I would like.  Hopefully then clock will drift toward zero over the next few days and then I will make a final adjustment in the new year.
1292053200 -1 The Bedmaker Effect is absent - as expected, it is a Saturday.  But I have a theory for what has been going on, and the sums sort-of stack up  http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/theory/BedmakerEffect.pdf .  Essentially, warm air is forced into the pendulum chamber causing amplitude to increase due to reduced drag and going to decrease because the outer tube of the pendulum warms up - it takes a while for the temperature compensation to reach equilibrium.  A test to do on a cold morning next week will be to leave the door open for long enough for an equilibrium to be reached. 
1291973400 -1 ADJUST: -900 ms/day to 27200   should stabilize now that the draught-up-the-pendulum problem is fixed
1291967100 -1 cleaning lady leaving the door open.  Hopefully over the weekend there will be no such glitches at 07h45, nor next week during which I have asked her to leave the door closed.  Perhaps, as a treat, I will let her open the door next Friday!
1291880100 -1 So the plot thickens.  I went in at 07h30 to see what is responsible for this amplitude glitch at 07h35 every morning http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=09/12/2010&xmin=7&xmax=9&channel=amp&skip=5&scale=auto , it happened again today.  Is it the strike silencer?  No, this releases at around 07h20.  Is it the sun at sunrise?  No, the sun does not shine on the clock tower until about 08h10, and it is not until 08h45 that the window into the clock case is out of the shadow of the S-E turret.  Is it the central heating switching on?  Well, not sure, but the event is so sudden and short-lived that the heating switch-on cannot really be responsible.  But at precisely 07h35 I heard a noise.  It was the cleaning lady opening the door of Dr Hopkinsons room below.  I went down to see her and asked if she came in at this time every day and she said yes, exactly this time - not on weekends.  How long does she stay?  About 10 minutes.  Now, when she cleans she leaves the door wide open.  This might explain why Dr Hopkinsons comings and goings have no effect.  So I asked her if she would leave the door open again tomorrow but next week she will close the door when she cleans.  We will see if it makes a difference.  But I am still really puzzled:  the pendulum chamber is now (since Tuesday) fully taped up and I cannot see any obvious places for draughts to get anywhere near the clock.  Maybe there is a non-draught-related explanation - perhaps the cleaning lady is attractive to long swinging objects?  Next week will be interesting.  (By the way, this glitch is small by comparison to others eg pigeons and spiders, but it is curious all the same)
1291832520 -1 here is an experiment, showing the effect on amplitude of the maintaining weight http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=08/12/2010&xmin=16&xmax=21&channel=amp&channel2=going&skip=20&scale=auto , over a period of 18 minutes.  It seems that the maintaining weight reduces pendulum amplitude at a rate of 0.01mrad/min.  This is due to pallet friction, I think.  It makes the effect observed earlier today all the more puzzling - the same rate of change but in the opposite direction!  Note that the increased maintaining weight has no effect on going, but the 07h35 glitch shows on amplitude AND going.  There is another effect in play here.  What a mystery! 
1291793700 -1 what is this glitch http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=08/12/2010&xmin=6&xmax=9&channel=amp&channel2=going&skip=10&scale=auto ?  It lasts for about 10 minutes, increases amplitude by about 0.015mrad/min and seems to occur every morning at around 07h35.  Now that the draught problem appears to be solved we can see more little features.  maye it is something to do with the strike-sliencing mechanism?  The thought is that it affects the going train as it releases between 7am and 8am.  But surely this should have the same effect as the maintaining weight - ie increasing pallet friction and therefore reducing pendulum amplitude.  I should check the effect of the maintaining weight this evening.
1291762800 -1 sealed up the pendulum chamber with tape.  Note that pendulum amplitude drops straight away - a good sign.  The amplitude rapidly settles to a steady value overnight.  The test will be at 8am tomorrow - will there be a glitch in amplitude?  I hope not.
1291708800 -1 Recently there have been sudden shifts in pendulum amplitude starting at around 8am every day.  I suspect this is when the heating comes on, or perhaps when the cleaning lady opens the door in the room below.  It is regular as clockwork on weekdays (see today(Tuesday)  http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=07/12/2010&channel=amp&channel2=temp&type=two&ymin=46.5&ymax=49&scale=auto and yesterday http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=06/12/2010&channel=amp&channel2=temp&ymin=46.5&ymax=49&type=two&scale=auto but note that there was no glitch on Sunday http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=05/12/2010&channel=amp&channel2=temp&ymin=46.5&ymax=49&type=two&scale=auto).  Whatever the cause, recent cold weather has highlighted the variability of pendulum amplitude with air temperature.  There is a cold draft coming out of the cracks around the door of the pendulum chamber so perhaps air currents around the pendulum are to blame.  Suspected this for ages, so maybe tonight I should seal up the gaps and find out. 
1291566600 -1 ADJUST: +1100 ms/day to 28100 The amplitude is very high.  Is there something to do with a cold draught in the pendulum shaft?  Replaced covers to minimize space for air flow.
1290959400 -1 ADJUST: +600 ms/day to 27000 still settling in
1290951000 -1 ADJUST: +700 ms/day to 26400
1290892200 -1 ADJUST: +000 ms/day to 25700 note that we have a new weight configuration
1290889800 -1 Note that the temperature rose during this exercise - we had a fan heater going because the outside temperature was sub-zero.  This should give us a good opportunity to see if the temperature compensation is working as it cools down overnight...
1290888000 -1 We finally got it all back together after about 5 hours work, only to find that the clock was gaining about 140 seconds per day.  We then had to wind down the regulation nut on the pendulum bob by 3.5 turns.  We then had to reset the bells, but in so doing we found that the second hand was out-of-synch with the quarters bells.  All these unintended consequences of our simple readjustment of the pendulum!
1290880800 +1 We re-assembled the pendulum, but in so doing we noticed that we had bent the gravity arms of the escapement.  In order to prevent further damage we removed the gravity arms.  We also re-instated the original suspension (as was removed in October).  The repositioning of the gravity arms caused problems with bouncing of the escapement so we decided to adjust the fly on the escapement.  This did not work so we had to dismantle the fly.
1290874800 +1 Today we (Graham Newman, Mark Rainer, Hugh Hunt) had a go at fixing the temperature compensation of the pendulum.  We stopped the clock at 16h20, disconnected the barometric compensator, removed the optic sensor, then Mark had made up a neat cradle for the pendulum bob so that we could remove the pendulum shaft while leaving the bob behind.  We then dismantled the pendulum.  There was a bit of corrosion but not enough to explain a lock-up of the compensator.  We found that the zinc tube was bent by about 3mm at its centre - perhaps enough to have locked the mechanism up if it had got twisted?
1289942100 +1 Correction of -15 seconds for a reverse pigeeon event. It seems that the removal of the weights on the gravity arms (17h30 30 Oct) means that the gravity arms jump more easily, as observed when the maintaining weight is engaged alongside the main driving weight.  A Pigeon on the hands at hh:15 will have the same effect as a maintaining weight.  
1289921700 +1 ADJUST: +800 ms/day to 29500   It is clear that the temperature compensation has gone wrong http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=05/11/2010&to=16/11/2010&channel=going&channel2=temp&type=xy&scale=auto .  Quite possibly when we adjusted the regulation nut we managed to jam something in the set of steel/zinc concentric tubes that make up the pendulum http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/tempcompensator.html
1289462400 +1 TC works staff were checking out clearance in the pendulum case - they must have touched the pendulum
1289309100 +1 ADJUST: -500 ms/day to 28700  Now that the pendulum is swinging nicely we can see that the temperature compensation is not ideal - sticking somewhere?
1288859151 +1 ADJUST: +500 ms/day to 29200   maybe the new suspension is settling in.  No matter how tight the screws are the spring will ratchet down against friction.
1288708200 +1 ADJUST: +200 ms/day to 28700  - a minor adjustment, given how much change there was on Saturday
1288468800 +1 The new steady-state amplitude of the pendulum appears to be 48mrad where it was 55mrad before the gravity arm weights were removed.  The going seems to be very steady. 
1288463400 +1 the clock was restarted and adjusted to winter time.
1288461000 +1 ADJUST: -000 ms/day to 28500  NB new weight configuration due to big changes today.   the clock was stopped again to allow the strike to be correctly positioned and for the adjustment for winter time to be be effected.
1288459800 +0 it was observed that the pendulum amplitude is much greater than it used to be - climbing to over 60mrad.  It was decided to remove the two extra weights from the gravity arms - thought to date from the mid eighties when Andrew Huxley had them installed  in order to prevent the clock from stopping.  It may be, way back then, that the problem all along was rubbing against the pendulum chamber door and impact with the door lock.
1288456200 +0 the clock was restarted.  After such drastic alteration to the pendulum the clock was going at -236 seconds per day so it was necessary to make drastic adjustment to resume steady going.  The regulation nut at the bottom of the pendulum was used.  First we tried 2 full turns, then 2 more, then 2 more.  This was too much.  It appears that each full turn increases the going by 45 seconds per day.  We then backed off by half a turn, then another half and then one final half turn.  This is where we left it.
1288452600 +0 a new suspension was installed.  It has 100mm radius cycloidal cheeks and these may help to regulate the variation of going with amplitude.  It has a thinner flexure.  The barometric compensator was re-installed.  The computer logging system was re-located to the easte end of the clock room, and the associated instrumentation was also moved.  It all looks a lot tidier.
1288449000 +0 The clock was stopped.  The pendulum suspension was removed in order to understand why the pendulum moves with a twist.  There is accumulated grime in the suspension but no sign of a crack as was suspected.  What seems to be happening, though, is that not only has the pendulum has been rubbing on the pendulum-case door it has also been bumping into the door lock.  We have removed all obstruction from the pendulum case door and hopefully this will give the pendulum a free swing.
1288447200 +0 A big day of work planned.  Present were Rosie Ayton, Sam Ricketson, Hilary Costello, Tim Gale, Mark Rainer, Graham Newman, Hugh Hunt
1287493800 +0 ADJUST: -400 ms/day to 43170
1286031900 +0 ADJUST: +250 ms/day to  43570  witnessed by Cindy and Rob.  Not sure why I should be doing this - the going was so good early in September and now it has gone all over the place.  Perhaps time to look at the suspension spring... Rob, stickler for symmetry, had me put the regulation weights more evenly on each side of the pendulum shaft - maybe this will help!
1285843500 +0 The pigeons are certainly back, caused a 30-second glitch 
1285404300 +0 A pigeon event, caused a glitch of 27 seconds
1284630300 +0 The first pigeon event of the autumn. They are back.  Damn.  http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=16%2F09%2F2010&xmin=9.5&xmax=10&skip=1&channel=amp&scale=auto
1284364800 +0 Something happened here - after two weeks of beautiful steady going the amplitude has suddenly dropped and the clock is racing.  I suspect the pendulum is touching something.  Maybe the door to the case has blown itself closed?
1283857200 +0 Wonderful steady going.  The sudden pressure drop due to recent bad weather did not affect the going - barometric compensator working very well.
1283856300 +0 Bill and Shirley Burbidge from Perth WA visited today.  While waiting they saw two pigeons land on the minute hand at 11h45.  They said that the minute hand bounced up and down as if it were on springs.  Interesting that the two pigeons didn not cause a glitch.  Maybe it takes three!  I really need photographs...
1283259000 +0 ADJUST: +120 ms/day to 43320 as witnessed by Sean Holden.  The aim now is to be at zero for time change in October.
1281132000 +0 correction +48 seconds for pigeon even of 29 July - see <http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=29/07/2010&to=29/07/2010&xmin=7.5&xmax=8&skip=1&channel=drift&channel2=amp&type=two&scale=auto> - thanks Anson Cheung for doing this!
1280992500 +0 ADJUST: +300 ms/day 43200ms
1280816400 +0 A massive effect!  One theory for why the pendulum only sometimes rubs the door of the clock case is that the lean of the tower varies with seasons and temperature.  Ground water table variations will affect foundations (the post on my garden gate demonstrates this admirably).  Also I estimate that the sun shining on the south-facing wall of the tower could cause a 5C temperature difference between the S and N faces, hence causing a lean, and 0.2mm shift in the position of the pendulum ... 
1280770200 +0 Restart computer after a power cut.  Also opened the pendulum door a bit.  Et voila!  The going is now -300ms/day.  Looks as if Graham-the-sleuth Newman hit the nail on the head.  We will wait and see...
1280700000 +0 Graham sensibly suggested that maybe the door of the pendulum case is rubbing on the pendulum - this would make sense as we closed the door firmly and locked it, where it was only partially closed before.  This would reduce pendulum amplitude and hence speed the clock up
1280389800 +0 Pigeon on minute hand, about 45 seconds duration, see <http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=29/07/2010&to=29/07/2010&xmin=7.5&xmax=8&skip=1&channel=drift&channel2=amp&type=two&scale=auto> - corrected 6 Aug 2010
1279993200 +0 Today we had a visit from the Antiquarian Horological Society - Turret Clock Group.  More experts the clock has surely never seen.  A good day was had by all.  Afterwards Graham Newman and I tried to measure the diameter of the pendulum bob - without stopping it.  I was holding the tape measure, but I guess I slipped ... hence the glitch on amplitude and drift.
1278860700 +0 ADJUST: -100 ms/day 42900.  This hot weather is doing something strange.  Not surprised!  Helped today by the Gunners: Vanessa, Alex, Melissa, Sumie and Chris.
1278455400 +0 ADJUST: -100 ms/day 43000.   Needed a bit more.  Thanks to Eduardo, Cecilia, Zoran, Kai und Michael
1278050400 +0 power cut caused logging system to shut down.  Restart thanks to Tim Gale, the earlybird.  Webcam was not restarted - we arere working on it.
1277856000 +0 I think this sudden change in going is caused by a change in the direction of air flow up the pendulum chamber
1276524000 +0 ADJUST: -250 ms/day 43100ms, Clearly I did not get this right.  Try again (with the help of Jane, James, Maggie, Elsie, Naomi!)
1274014800 +0 ADJUST: +30 ms/day 43350ms, getting fussy!  I should really wait now to see what the barocompensator does.
1273263300 +0 ADJUST: -50 ms/day 43320ms, just a little bit more...
1272366300 +0 ADJUST: -130 ms/day 43370ms, this is a final adjustment (hopefully) after fitting of the barometric compensator.  The clock is currently 0.14s fast and it would be great if it stayed that way for a few months ...
1271368800 +0 can anyone explain why the pendulum amplitude should increase suddenly like this: http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=15/04/2010&to=16/04/2010&xmin=12&xmax=36&skip=10&channel=amp&channel2=temp&scale=auto .  It happens gradually over two hours from 10pm to midnight.  The only thought I have is reduced friction on the escapement as the cable on the drum winds down from the second layer to the first, but if so then why does it not happen every week?
1270684800 +0 removed the reference gradient lines for Going vs Pressure because the barometric compensator seems to be doing its job.
1269947100 +0 introduced a plate to reduce airflow past the pendulum.  There has been a step change in going - I wonder if this it related?
1269775200 +0 ADJUST: -1500 ms/day 43500ms, bringing to -2600ms/day the total mass compensation for the barometric compensator
1269735300 +0 ADJUST: -1100 ms/day 45000ms, necessary to compensate for the mass of the barometric compensator.  Will need further adjustment in the morning.
1269735000 +0 fitted a barometric compensator http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/barocompensator.html , mass of compensator is 1.854kg, installed close to the pendulum flexure.  As a guess, the CoG of the compnesator is between 2% to 5% away from the flexure towards the adjustment table, hence expect to have to remove about 20 to 60 grams of weight, equivalent to about 2000 to 6000ms/day 
1269734700 +0 plugged gaps under the floor boards to reduce air currents - and maybe to deter spiders.
1269734400 +0 clock advanced for summer time. 
1269507600 +0 restart after another outage
1269204600 +0 logger restart after a power outage
1269087300 +0 ADJUST: +100 ms/day 46100ms, and advanced 30 sec for pigeon event
1268844300 +0 pigeon on the minute hand caused the clock to stop for 30 seconds
1267963200 +0 After a College-wide power outage the computer system was restarted.
1267771680 -1 Pigeon event (now that the sun is shining again).  Reset by 54 seconds on Sat 6 March, 13h15
1266927300 -1 ADJUST: -200 ms/day 46000ms (barometric pressure is forecast to stay low for several more days yet...)
1264762800 -1 ADJUST: -300 ms/day 46200ms (settling down to a final value, still 100ms/day more than in summer 2009)
1264276800 -1 ADJUST: +500 ms/day 46500ms
1264275000 -1 The difficultly in setting the Going is, I think, due to air currents up and down the pendulum chamber.  If air is flowing upwards then drag reduces effective g and in addition the amplitude increases.  Both these effects slow the clock down.  It may be that there is a switch between upflow in spring (warm air rises) and downflow in autumn (cold air is heavy).  Note the step change in going around mid November.
1263909000 -1 ADJUST: +500 ms/day leaving 46000 ms
1263337800 -1 ADJUST: -200 ms/day leaving 45500 ms
1263337200 -1 Unfortunately, the cardboard was gently touching the pendulum which caused a massive hike in the going.  Corrected.
1263298500 -1 Pigeon glitch correction of 36 seconds.  Also put some cardboard baffles around the pendulum shaft in an attempt to reduce the updraft and downdraft that appears to be affecting the going.
1263298200 -1 ADJUST: +700 ms/day (to 45700 ms of weights) - hope to be back to time next Tuesday
1263044700 -1 More pigeons - twice (30 seconds stoppage) http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=9%2F01%2F2010&xmin=13.5&xmax=14&skip=1&channel=amp&scale=auto
1262962200 -1 ADJUST: -1000 ms/day (to 45000 ms of weights) - I want to get the drift back to near zero.  It seems as if the winter going is faster than the summer going.  Does this mean that the temperature compensation is not quite right?
1262701200 -1 75sec correction for pigeon on 29 Dec
1262700900 -1 ADJUST: -100 ms/day (to 46000 ms of weights)
1262076300 -1 pigeon caused 75 second stoppage http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=29%2F12%2F2009&xmin=7.5&xmax=8&skip=1&channel=amp&scale=auto, corrected on 5 Jan.
1260369900 -1 another pigeon caused 9 second stoppage http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=09%2F12%2F2009&xmin=14.5&xmax=15&skip=1&channel=amp&scale=auto see photo at  http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/photos.html#pigeons
1260269100 -1 pigeons stopped the clock for 4 minutes - this is getting serious! If you look closely you can see 3 separate pigeon events http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=08%2F12%2F2009&xmin=10.5&xmax=11&skip=1&channel=amp&scale=auto
1260182700 -1 pigeons on the minute hand, 30 second glitch http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=07%2F12%2F2009&xmin=10.5&xmax=11&skip=1&channel=amp&scale=auto
1260177300 -1 bumped the pendulum accidentally.
1259999100 -1 another glitch http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=05%2F12%2F2009&xmin=7.5&xmax=8&skip=1&channel=amp&ymin=53.3&ymax=53.7 .  BUT we now know what causes the glitches:  Mr Down (a College Porter) saw a pigeon sitting on the minute hand.  Indeed, the glitches always occur around hh:40 to hh:50 (when the minute hand is horizontal and rising) , and always in daylight hours.  The pigeons are present on the dial in large numbers especially when the sun is shining - a warm south-facing place to sit http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/photos.html#pigeons .  A quick calculation:  suppose two pigeon each weighing 1kg are sitting on the minute hand at a distance of 0.5m from the pivot, and so rising at about 1mm/sec.  They requires 10mW of power to lift them (force*velocity).  Then the 80kg _going_ weight falling 9m in 7 days generates 12mW of power (again force*velocity).  So a power balance suggests that a pigeon or two can easily stop the clock.
1259669400 -1 pendulum case in Dr Hopkinson s room opened, very noticable downdraft.  Caused clock to speed up - as expected from theory.
1259056200 -1 glitch of 33 seconds, fixed at 13h00 same day http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=24%2F11%2F2009&xmin=9.5&xmax=10&skip=1&channel=amp&scale=auto
1258275600 -1 power outage caused data-logging PC to shut down (College disconnected due to works on the new electricity supply to the Kitchens).  The weather station data (pressure, temperature, humidity) seems to have been permanentlly affected.  Will need to be fixed.
1258023600 -1 solar glazing installed, hopefully will help keep the sun from shining too hotly on the pendulum
1257411000 -1 glitch of 9 seconds, http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=05%2F11%2F2009&xmin=8.5&xmax=9&skip=1&channel=amp&scale=auto fixed 09h45 the following day
1257273300 -1 glitch adjustment
1257263400 -1 glitch of 30 seconds http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=03%2F11%2F2009&xmin=15.5&xmax=16&skip=1&channel=amp&scale=auto .  I think the cable of the going is jamming somewhere  
1256429700 -1 End of Summer Time adjustment, clock advanced by 23 hours
1256043600 -1 corection of 9s glitch, plus wind the clock, plus preparation for clock change on Sunday morning
1255952700 -1 another glitch http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=19%2F10%2F2009&xmin=11.5&xmax=12&skip=1&channel=amp&scale=auto
1255095000 -1 New GPS installed.  Normal data gathering resumed.
1254759000 -1 GPS fault - data gathering halted.  New GPS received on order.
1254379500 -1 another .... http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=01%2F10%2F2009&xmin=6.5&xmax=7&skip=1&channel=amp&scale=auto
1254222000 -1 correction of 9s glitch plus attention to the freedom of movement of the weight cables - perhaps they are not sliding so freely against each other as they should, and a little freeing up was attempted.
1254120600 -1 another glitch http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=28%2F9%2F2009&xmin=6.5&xmax=7&skip=1&channel=amp&scale=auto
1254044580 -1 yet another glitch in amplitude http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=27%2F9%2F2009&xmin=9.5&xmax=10&skip=1&channel=amp&scale=auto , this time only 9 seconds in duration.  What causes this?  A real mystery.
1253916360 -1 reset the time - interesting that it was only 1min40sec slow, even though the pendulum decay was over 3 minutes.  The plot thickens!
1253898000 -1 8 days later, the same has happened again.  Almost identical drop in amplitude over 3 minutes.
1253267808 -1 advanced clock by over 3 minutes - whatever it was that happened last night it stopped the clock for quite a while.  Close inspection of the amplitude data shows that the escapement was _stuck_ for 3mins 20sec.  Is there a big spider about?  Or a rat?
1253204000 -1 what on earth happened here?  Amplitude dropped by 2 mm!
1253018731 -1 during the winding I accidentally touched the pendulum - hence a glitch in amplitude.  It should settle quite quickly
1251715140 -1 ADJUST: +150 ms/day (back to 46100 ms of weights).  This is because the clock has had a mean drift of around -150ms/day for the month of August, and has dropped 4 seconds.  Curious, though, that the clock was actually 23 seconds slow today.  I wonder if a mouse/rat gets into the fly and stops the escapement from time to time?  Something seems to be happening.  Really need a webcam!
1251205200 -1 Is this another spider?  The amplitude has dropped for a few hours, no particular feature in meteo properties.
1250861400 -1 Computer restarted, thanks to Sam Wenham and Rick Lupton
1248962400 +2 PC FAILURE - no data available until further notice.  Sorry!
1247998800 +2 ADJUST: -150 ms/day (to 45950 ms of weights).  The clock has crept to 3.4 seconds fast and is averaging 50ms/day fast.  I hope now to drop 100ms/day for 30 days to bring the clock back in line, but who knows what the weather will do - and the spiders.
1247561100 +2 ANNUAL SERVICE by Smith of Derby (Jonathan Lee and Matthew Smith).  I asked them not to interfere with the escapement or the pendulum.   They investigated weights scraping against the stonework during winding, found that the First Strike (Trinity Strike) was scraping.  They will make a minor adjustment.  Also invesitgated the uneven winding of the Going line on the Going drum.  We tried refitting the line at the ratchet end but found that the line then interfered with the quarters advancing bar.  General service involving oiling and a check over.  As a result, pendulum amplitude has dropped.  I wonder if it will recover?
1246940800 +2 another amplitude glitch.  We really need a webcam looking for spiders!
1246736100 +2  1100 ms/day removed briefly to check calibration
1246618800 +2 ... no further adjustment necessary (a pleasant surprise)
1246554000 +2 replaced miscellaneous washers with calibrated brass weights (courtesy Gareth Ryder who has also made a nice box for them).  It was not possible to get the weight exactly right so I suppose an adjustment will be needed tomorrow, or over the weekend after the amplitude has settled down.
1245058200 +2 ADJUST: -130 ms/day (to 46100 ms)
1244727900 +2 Logging interrupted to install UPS.
1244433600 +2 ... another spider?  What caused the 1mrad (=1mm) drop in amplitude at 4am, recovered 2 hours later?
1242747878 +2 Another curiosity is that small changes of Going vs Amplitude http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=10%2F05%2F2009&to=19%2F05%2F2009&channel=going&channel2=amp&type=xy&scale=auto&width=1000&submit=Update shows a positive slope - not sure why.  And there seem to be clusters - as if behaviour changes quickly and sits still for a while.  The normal physics of a pendulum http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/theory/period-amp.html predicts a negative slope, as here http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=02%2F05%2F2009&to=04%2F05%2F2009&channel=going&channel2=amp&type=xy&scale=auto&width=1000&submit=Update so there is something more subtle going on.  Maybe the spider again?
1242745100 +2 Just a general remark, it has been noticable over the last few days that pendulum amplitude forms a nice linear relationship with air density.  This fits perfectly with a 0.5*rho*V^2 drag law.  see http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=07%2F05%2F2009&to=19%2F05%2F2009&channel=amp&channel2=density&type=xy&scale=fixed&width=1000&submit=Update
1242734700 +2 clock wound at 1.05pm - note the small glitch in amplitude, perhaps opening the clock case causes air currents that causing a small change in pendulum motion.  Or maybe the act of winding moves the clock bed slightly causing the pendulum to be disturbed.
1242518400 +2 ... and why has it suddenly changed back at midnight?  There is no change in anything else - some physics not accounted for here!
1242343800 +2 What caused this gradual change in going, over 8 hours before and after midnight?
1242129900 +2 clock wound at 1.05pm.  temp is stable and going seems to be spot on zero.  Might this last until October now? 
1241600400 +2 the spider again?  Things settle down well after this - back to normal and very good running.
1241366400 +2 very strange event, amplitude dropped by 1mrad so clock sped up by 1s/day, corrected itself the next morning.  Could this have been a spider spinning its web between the pendulum and the casing?  This is a really good event to plot as Going vs Amplitude becvause it obeys the pendulum physics beautifully.  http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/clock/data.html?from=02%2F05%2F2009&to=04%2F05%2F2009&channel=going&channel2=amp&type=xy&scale=auto&width=1000&submit=Update
1241182800 +2 ADJUST: +80 ms/day (to speed the clock up)
1239757200 +2 clock stopped due to lack of winding
1237559171 -1 logger restarted
